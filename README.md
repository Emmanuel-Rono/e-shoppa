## Architecture
MVVM (Model - ViewModel - View) is the design pattern used for making this app. 
MVVM provides a clear separation of concern and has great support in Android SDK in the form of [Architecture Components][1].

## Libraries Used

* [Architecture][1] - A collection of libraries that help you design robust, testable, and
  maintainable apps.
  * [Data Binding][2] - Declaratively bind observable data to UI elements.
  * [LiveData][3] - Build data objects that notify views when the underlying database changes.
  * [Room][4] - Access your app's SQLite database with in-app objects and compile-time checks.
  * [ViewModel][5] - Store UI-related data that isn't destroyed on app rotations. Easily schedule
     asynchronous tasks for optimal execution.
  * [Navigation][12] - Handle everything needed for in-app navigation.
* Third party
  * [Glide][7] for image loading
  * [Kotlin Coroutines][8] for managing background threads with simplified code and reducing needs for callbacks
  * [MPAndroidChart][9] to chart the financial data
  * [Retrofit][10] for making HTTP requests
